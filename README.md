# Rascal_MiniDOT

To run a graph example after cloning the repository, go to the "Main.rsc" file, and click on "Run in new Rascal terminal" above the "main()" method.
Alternatively, start a new Rascal terminal, and run the method by typing "main()" from the right directory.

To visualize the textual graph, copy-pase the generated text in an online application like Graphviz.

To make or modify a custom graph, change "input\Graph.txt".
